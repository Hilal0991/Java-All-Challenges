How It Works

Step-by-step:

1.Initialize Tickets

A list of predefined ticket strings is stored in an array.

2.Process Each Ticket For each ticket:

-Remove dashes to form a single string of digits.

-Convert each character to an integer.

-Calculate the sum and average of the digits.

-Print the result for that ticket.

3.Determine Winner

Track the ticket with the highest digit average.

Print the winning ticket and its average.

🔧 Key Concepts Used

-Arrays (String[], int[])

-String manipulation (replace, toCharArray)

-Character-to-integer conversion

-Looping (for-each, for loops)

-Tracking max values using conditionals

🛠 Possible Improvements

-Round average to 2 decimal places for cleaner output.

-Accept ticket inputs from the user instead of hardcoding.

-Validate format of ticket numbers.
