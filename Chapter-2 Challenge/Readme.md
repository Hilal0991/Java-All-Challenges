1. Security (Sandbox Model)
Applets are not allowed to:
a) Access or modify files on the user’s computer.

b) Connect to any server other than the one they were downloaded from.

2. Modern Replacement
Modern web technologies that replaced applets:
• HTML5

• CSS3

• JavaScript

Example:

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we can animate text easily.

3. Legacy Importance
It’s important for developers to understand applets because:
• They were an early example of web-embedded Java code.

• Understanding them helps us see how web technology evolved.

• Many legacy systems in old enterprises may still have appletbased interfaces.
