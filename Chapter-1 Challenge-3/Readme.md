🧭 Game Flow

-You start with 100 health points.

-The game randomly determines what happens in each of the 5 rooms.

-If your health drops to 0 or below, the game ends in defeat.

-If you survive all 5 rooms, you win!


⚙️ Room Events

Each room randomly triggers one of the following:

1. 🪤 Trap

You lose 20 health points.


2. 🧪 Healing Potion

You gain 15 health points.

Your health cannot exceed 100 (it's capped).


3. 👹 Monster Encounter

You must guess a number between 1 and 5.

If your guess is wrong, you try again until you guess correctly.

When correct, the monster is defeated and you move to the next room.
